🔵  Why Data Engineering is important?
Data engineering helps make data more useful and accessible for consumers of data. To do so, Data engineering must source, transform and analyze data from each system. For example, data stored in a relational database is managed as tables, like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Each table contains many rows, and all rows have the same columns. A given piece of information, such as a customer order, may be stored across dozens of tables.

🔵  Why should you opt for a Data Engineering career?
Data engineers must have specialized skills in creating software solutions around data. At the same time, it’s perhaps unrealistically expected that Data Engineers will be familiar with a breadth of tools and technologies – anywhere from 10 to 30 of them. And these tools are constantly changing.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

Why I Prefer Data Engineering Roles,ilqpqjyYVFI,"With all the hype around machine learning, why do I like data engineering gigs more?

LogikBot - Affordable, Real-World and Comprehensive - https://www.logikbot.com

There are two core paths on LogikBot. One for the data analyst role and one for the machine learning engineering role. 

I've added the data analyst role recently because machine learning has become so difficult to break into. If you're new to IT, I'd highly recommend this path. You can be in a real-world data analsyt role in under a year if you really apply yourself.  LogikBot is the most affordable and fastest way to attain this role. The platform even has an exam simulator for preparing for the exam. 

For the data analyst role, you take two courses then prepare for and pass exam PL-300. This exam, PL-300, is the Microsoft Certified PowerBI Data Analyst Certification.  

If you're in a shortcut role, then there's an entire path laid out for learning machine learning. The platform used by Uber and Microsoft. I worked at both companies. The courses are real-world and comprehensive. This is not the easy way. There is no easy way. This is one of the few platform that's offers a real-world approach to working in AI.",2022-06-02T19:13:12Z,17066,791,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqpqjyYVFI,the data janitor,UCR68xPzQK7Etq2YfJ6Oe_2A,,2022-02-12T15:39:16.513627Z,US,47100,1943380,539,N/A,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR68xPzQK7Etq2YfJ6Oe_2A,https://yt3.ggpht.com/nP6kU4IwVSfHNx9Ur7_8Xlfc6-b4zBBRSR8XjN_dVn48PGF5wso74nBC-Cnod6eDS7hv0QwI_g=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

How do data engineers work? 🤔 (Tamil) | data engineer work example,mhZKOMiE6T0,"Data engineers gather data from various sources for different kinds of clients. For example, Amazon might need to check product data for a specific area and its use case. To do this, Amazon analyzes some results and sends the data to a particular place. 📊

In that place, data analysts or data scientists pick and analyze the data to get valid results. These results help the client understand the production of the product. 🛠️

This entire process is the work of data engineers. 💼

Put in simpler words, 
A data pipeline is a series of activities that ingest raw data from many sources and transport it to a destination for storage and analysis.

I am a self-taught data scientist from non-tech background, currently at a FAANG company. I have been in the industry for over 10 years across two big tech companies as a high-performer (top 1%).

Data Science is the hottest job family but there are many unknowns. Over the years,  I have built knowledge on how to lead a successful career and love sharing it on this channel. I share tips for people interested in entering data science with the goal to democratize knowledge and make complicated topics digestible for everyone.

Is It Time to Say Goodbye to Data Engineers? - The Data Engineering Dilemma,4FcG_ocJ41Y,"Ever since tools like SSIS came onto the scene, vendors and business leaders have been on a mission to remove what they see as the biggest roadblock to data-driven decision-making: data engineers.

Or their counterparts—DBAs, ETL Developers, and Data Architects.

Sure, not everyone says it so explicitly, but you can see it in vendor marketing and in the decisions made by the business.

I remember talking to a veteran data expert who’s been in the field for three decades. They told me that when SSIS first launched, people were genuinely afraid for their jobs. The idea that you could just drag-and-drop tasks that once required code was nerve-racking. But if you’ve used SSIS, well, you know the truth.

To some extent, I get why the idea is appealing. When a leader requests a report, a software engineer wants to modify an application table, or a data scientist wants to explore a new dataset, who’s the one slowing down the project?

The data engineers.

With their rules. Their governance. Their insistence on building robust, scalable data pipelines instead of quick fixes.

They really slow down the workflow!

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

What tools should you know as a Data Engineer?,UDmViyjdHuw,"Want to build a reliable, modern data architecture without the mess? 
Here’s a free checklist to help you → https://bit.ly/kds-checklist 

The modern data engineering stack is overwhelming...

Everyday there seems to be a new tool and it can be hard to know what to learn.

While it’d be impossible to share every single possible option...

in this video I want to share some of the most commonly used ones across the modern stack.

Use the tools mentioned in this video to guide your learning.

Figure out what you want to learn next and overall become more aware of what's out there. 

**Important Note**
We'll be going through a lot of tools in this video. I want you to know that you don't need to learn how to use every single platformed mentioned to be a great data engineer. 

I personally have not used all of them in depth and I've never met anybody who is an expert at them all either. 

Ultimately the goal is to give you a perspective of the overall data landscape and help guide your journey to becoming a great engineer.  Pick out one tool you don't know today and start learning it. Once you master that, move on to another.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the most powerful tools in data engineering, and I’m excited to share my top four must-haves with you! 🌟

🔧 Apache Spark: This unified analytics engine has revolutionized the way I process big data, offering blazing-fast computation and seamless integration with Hadoop. Spark has been my go-to for large-scale data processing, enabling real-time analytics and machine learning.

📅 Apache Airflow: Managing workflows has never been easier. Airflow allows me to schedule, monitor, and optimize complex data pipelines efficiently. With its dynamic pipeline generation and robust UI, I can ensure that every data task runs smoothly.

🔍 dbt (Data Build Tool): Transforming data in the warehouse has become a breeze with dbt. By leveraging SQL for data modeling and transformations, dbt has streamlined my ELT processes, allowing for version control and collaborative efforts.

🚀 Kubernetes: Orchestrating containerized applications is essential for any scalable data engineering workflow. Kubernetes automates deployments, scales efficiently, and ensures high availability, making it an indispensable tool in my arsenal.

🌐 Did you know? According to a study by Gartner, organizations that effectively manage and utilize data engineering tools can achieve up to a 30% increase in operational efficiency. This highlights the immense value these tools bring to the table.

Mastering these tools has been a game-changer in my data engineering journey. If you're diving into the world of data engineering, these are definitely the tools to invest your time in!",2024-07-20T13:15:07Z,15675,273,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM47yl_bRTA,Manish Sharma,UCQYO2p7JMcCp-9xIZxGP2Sg,"Manish Sharma, International Award Oracle ACE Pro Winning Data Engineer and founder of RebellionRider.com offers free tutorials on SQL, PL/SQL, Python, and Oracle Database.

🔵  Why Data Engineering is important?
Data engineering helps make data more useful and accessible for consumers of data. To do so, Data engineering must source, transform and analyze data from each system. For example, data stored in a relational database is managed as tables, like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Each table contains many rows, and all rows have the same columns. A given piece of information, such as a customer order, may be stored across dozens of tables.

🔵  Why should you opt for a Data Engineering career?
Data engineers must have specialized skills in creating software solutions around data. At the same time, it’s perhaps unrealistically expected that Data Engineers will be familiar with a breadth of tools and technologies – anywhere from 10 to 30 of them. And these tools are constantly changing.

Data Scientist vs Data Analyst vs Data Engineer : quelles différences ?

Être data scientist est considéré comme l’un des meilleurs métiers du 21ème siècle mais on s’aperçoit vite qu’il existe un grand nombre d’autres métiers comme Data Analyst ou Data Engineer. Quelles sont les différences entre Data Scientist vs Data Analyst vs Data Engineer ? Quel métier préférer lorsqu’on veut travailler en Data Science ou en Machine Learning ? Réponse dans cette vidéo en français.

00:00 Introduction
01:10 Le métier du Data Analyst
02:14 Le métier du Data Scientist
03:42 Le métier du Data Engineer
05:47 Les technologies du Data Analyst vs Data Scientist vs Data Engineer
07:26 Vers quel métier s'orienter ?

Le Data Analyst est celui qui va permettre d’orienter la stratégie d’une entreprise grâce à son analyse des données. Il va créer des tableaux mais également des graphiques et des diaporamas pour illustrer comme les données peuvent répondre à tel ou tel problème d’entreprise. Le Data Analyst va avoir un véritable impact sur l’entreprise. Il va utiliser des outils comme Excel et Powerpoint mais également R.

Le métier de Data Scientist a de nombreuses différences avec le Data Analyst. Il va procéder à une analyse des données plus poussée. Il va utiliser des outils mathématiques et scientifiques comme les algorithmes de Machine Learning, les modèles de Deep Learning ou les réseaux neuronaux. Le Data Scientist va créer une solution data qui va permettre d’obtenir des recommendations ou améliorer un produit par exemple. Il va utiliser R et Python mais également du SQL pour collecter les données pour faire de la Data Science.

Le Data Engineer va aider le Data Analyst et le Data Scientist en s’occupant de la collecte des données ainsi que de leur stockage. Il doit s’assurer que les données soient dans le bon format et qu’elles soient facilement accessibles. Le Data Engineer va utiliser SQL comme le Data Scientist mais il va aussi utiliser des outils plus techniques comme Spark.

Je vous conseille de travailler en tant que Data Engineer si vous êtes organisé, si vous souhaitez gérer des systèmes complexe de données. Vous devriez faire Data Analyst si vous avez facilement une vue d’ensemble d’un problème d’entreprise et vous arrivez à le diviser en petits problèmes data. Je vous conseille enfin de travailler en tant que Data Scientist comme métier si vous voulez avoir des missions similaires à celles du Data Engineer et du Data Analyst mais également si vous souhaitez travailler sur des modèles de Machine Learning ou de Deep Learning.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

ABOUT THE TALK:

Batch data processing (also known as ETL)  is time-consuming, brittle, and often unrewarding. Not only that, it’s hard to operate, evolve, and troubleshoot.

In this talk, we’ll discuss functional programming paradigm and explore how applying it to Data Engineering can bring a lot of clarity to the process. It helps solving some of the inherent problems of ETL, leads to more manageable and maintainable workloads and helps to implement reproducible and scalable practices. It empowers data teams to tackle larger problems and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

ABOUT THE SPEAKER:

Maxime Beauchemin works as a Senior Software Engineer at Lyft where he develops open source products that reduce friction and help generate insights from data. He is the creator and a lead maintainer of Apache Airflow [incubating], a data pipeline workflow engine; and Apache Superset [incubating], a data visualization platform; and is recognized as a thought leader in the data engineering field.

Before Lyft, Maxime worked at Airbnb on the ""Analytics & Experimentation Products team"". Previously, he worked at Facebook on computation frameworks powering engagement and growth analytics, on clickstream analytics at Yahoo!, and as a data warehouse architect at Ubisoft.

## Intro
- In the field of data engineering, you are frequently required to read and manipulate data.
- Python is the tool of choice to achieve that.
- In this video, we will cover the fundamentals of Python you need to become a data engineer
- If you are a beginner at coding, there is no need to get overwhelmed with complexities, the idea is to start small and over time as you use more in your daily workflow, the better you will get
- So for Data Engineering you should treat Python as a language to provide a means to an end, don’t need to master it, but you will use this a lot.

In this video, I will cover a sample project to build your first ETL pipeline

I'm Sumit Mittal - Founder & CEO of TrendyTech.

I transform the careers of Big data aspirants through my carefully curated masters program to help them evolve into Big data experts. I have put in my wholehearted effort to present to you the best online big data course through the experience gained by having worked on multiple challenging Big data projects as an EX-CISCO and VMware employee.

The journey began in 2018 with my passion for teaching. Started by training a few working professionals, and eventually quit my high-paying job to pursue my passion and to bring about a change in the professional lives of many.

I have incorporated effective learning approaches to master Big Data that have been assimilated over the years as an alumni of top educational organizations like NIT Trichy, BITS Pilani, and IIIT Bangalore.

In 2021, I've made it my sole mission to help but I wasn't sure of what, who and where.
Let me tell you about my why ?
With ALLAH's willing, growing up and at the beginning of my career, I didn't need help on technical, personal nor financial help to stay motivated nor focus, somehow I was sure something will come up, and I have always found my way with ALLAH's greatness and willing in better and worse.

But, I've indeed needed mentorship, and I still do.
In this channel, you'll get to learn more about my experiences and my thoughts.
You'll get the mentorship you need but you didn't know you need it.
You'll get to learn the artist and creative side of me too.

And most importantly, you'll learn things about yourself, you didn't even knew you're capable of.

Thank you for reading till here,
Stay tuned.

This is a long awaited video of mine- Lets build a complete End to End Azure Data Engineering Project. In this project we are going to create an end to end data platform right from Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Data Loading and Reporting. 

The tools that are covered in this project are,

1. Azure Data Factory
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
3. Azure Databricks
4. Azure Synapse Analytics
5. Azure Key vault
6. Azure Active Directory (AAD) and
7. Microsoft Power BI

The use case for this project is building an end to end solution by ingesting the tables from on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and then store the data in Azure Data Lake. Then Azure databricks is used to transform the RAW data to the most cleanest form of data and then we are using Azure Synapse Analytics to load the clean data and finally using Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure synapse analytics to build an interactive dashboard. Also, we are using Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the monitoring and governance purpose. 

Part 2 will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

5 Data Engineering Projects Ideas To Put On Your Resume,385mKftVr3I,"Dice's 2020 tech jobs report cites Data Engineering as the fastest growing job in 2020. Increasing by a staggering 50%, while Data Science roles only increased by 10%. 

You can rest assured that the influx of data engineering will not regress anytime soon. To bolster this supposition, the International Data Group (IDG) predicts that the five year compound growth rate (CAGR) of data utilization from 2021 to 2024 will outweigh the total data creation spanning the entirety of the last thirty years. Yes, you heard that correctly, thirty years, dating back far before the origins of both FaceBook, YouTube and Amazon.

We have established that data engineering is a well-paying position, in one of the fastest-growing tech fields, with relatively low competition. What is not to love?


So let's add a few data engineering project ideas to your resume.

Netflix vs Meta vs Airbnb: Data Engineering cultures,JFRYfBmRJaI,"How is data engineering different between Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb?

So, I started my big tech data engineering career at Facebook in 2016. I worked there for about 2 years. Then I jumped to Netflix where I worked for about 2 years. I’ve currently been at Airbnb for about a year. 

Working at these companies gave me a taste of a bunch of different flavors of data engineering. They have some similarities and some differences. Let’s dive into it! 

Let’s start with when I worked at Facebook. 
At Facebook, I worked in growth analytics data engineering. There was a strong focus in my role creating metrics that could be used to measure incremental impact of experiments. 

The languages I used: 
- Python
- SQL

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL
- Apache Hive
- Presto/Trino

The storage systems I used were:
- Hadoop

The file formats I used were:
- ORC (optimized row columnar)

The scheduler I used was Dataswarm (https://asiliconvalleyinsider.com/2016/05/01/data-engineering-facebook/), which is Facebook’s internal scheduler very similar in API design to Apache Airflow. 

My role at Facebook had the strongest focus on visualization out of the three companies. I used a mix of Tableau and an internal tool called Unidash (https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/i-hear-facebook-has-data-does-it-have-data-tools-a9f4c4d82ee7)

Data quality checks were generally put in after a data quality error in the data instead of proactively since Facebook really focuses on “moving fast” 

Something unique about Facebook was Presto was often used in ETL code where as at the other companies Presto is strictly used for auditing only and Spark does the heavy lifting. Also every pipeline I wrote at Facebook was SQL-based which is very different from Netflix and Airbnb. 

Next up, Netflix

At Netflix, I worked in platform and security data engineering. I did a mix of creating metrics for experiments and creating master data for the InfoSec teams to use. 

The languages I used were:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I used were:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto/Trino (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I used were:
- S3
- Apache Druid (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was an internal scheduler called Meson (https://netflixtechblog.com/meson-workflow-orchestration-for-netflix-recommendations-fc932625c1d9)  which took in a YAML file to generate the pipeline DAG. I prefer Python APIs for schedulers over YAML-based APIs. 

Proactive data quality was pushed heavily at Netflix. They really like the write-audit-publish pattern and want you to have all your ETLs use it. 

I did very light visualization work at Netflix. They have analytics engineers and viz specialists there who focus more deeply on it. 

Netflix also focused on unit and integration testing of ETLs, which Airbnb also does but Facebook did not since Facebook is so SQL-focused. 

Something unique about Netflix is there was a good mix of PySpark and Scala Spark due to their “freedom and responsibility” culture which allowed for more variations in ETLs.  



Next up, Airbnb

At Airbnb, I work in commercial products data engineering. I work mostly on creating high quality master data and leadership since I’m at tech lead at Airbnb. 

The languages I use are:
- Python
- SQL
- Scala 

The execution engines I use are:
- SparkSQL and Scala Spark
- Presto (for data audits and analysis)

The storage systems I use are:
- S3
- Apache Superset (for visualization)
- Postgres (for low-latency queries)

The file formats I used were:
- Parquet

The scheduler I used was of course, Apache Airflow, the popular open source tool created by Airbnb. 

Proactive data quality is pushed heavily at Airbnb. There’s a company wide process called the MIDAS process which is a very thorough process for creating high quality data (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469). We use an internal framework called Wall for our data quality checks (https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-built-wall-to-prevent-data-bugs-ad1b081d6e8f).",2022-02-11T01:57:47Z,17777,703,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFRYfBmRJaI,Data with Zach,UCAq9f7jFEA7Mtl3qOZy2h1A,"Learn data engineering from the best!

I worked for two years at Netflix as a senior data engineer and senior software engineer in 2018-2020.

How to Become a Data Engineer? | Check out the ultimate guide http://bit.ly/34DPiFj to find out or watch this video. We'll talk about becoming a data engineer, focusing on who the data engineer is, what they do, how much they make, and what education and skills you need to become one.

Who’s the data engineer and what do they do?

Data engineers are the Jedi Knights of data science. They rely on a blend of analysis, wisdom, experience, and judgment to make key decisions for a company’s success. A data engineer is a self-starter who is inspired to complete more than your usual number of tasks.

Data engineers are the ones to take things further up the data science pipeline. They use the data architects’ work as a steppingstone and then pre-processes the available data. These are the people who ensure the data is clean and organized and ready for the analysts to take over.

Data engineers also implement complex, large scale big data projects with a focus on collecting, managing, analyzing and visualizing large data sets. They are also the ones who turn raw data into insights using various tool sets, techniques, and cloud-based platforms.

That said, for a data engineer, knowledge of data modeling for both data warehousing and Big Data is a must, along with experience in the Big Data space (Hadoop Stack like M/R, HDFS, Pig, Hive, etc.). Of course, the ability to write, analyze, and debug SQL queries will helps the aspiring data engineer score high on any employer’s recruitment list.

In terms of soft skills, they are great team-players. A data engineer knows how to actively collaborate with data scientists and executives to build solutions and platforms that meet, or even exceed a company’s business needs!

Dive Deeper into Data Engineering on Databricks,uhZabeKxXBw,"To derive value from data, engineers need to collect, transform, and orchestrate data from various data types and source systems. However, today’s data engineering solutions support only a limited number of delivery styles, involve a significant amount of hand-coding, and have become resource-intensive. Modern data engineering requires more advanced data lifecycle for data ingestion, transformation, and processing. In this session, learn how the Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides an end-to-end data engineering solution — ingestion, processing and scheduling — that automates the complexity of building and maintaining pipelines and running ETL workloads directly on a data lake, so your team can focus on quality and reliability to drive valuable insights.

Back To The Basics Of Data Engineering - Why SFTP Remains Essential for Companies,fKVFvW9JaFg,"Every day, companies share data sets of users, patient claims, financial transactions, and more with each other.

Most people might assume this would be via API. However, companies have been sharing data for decades using CSVs, TSVs, positional files, and other formats you might not be familiar with. Not via API, but SFTP.

I know I wouldn’t have guessed that’s how companies send data back and forth when I was in school.

If you’ve been in the industry for a while, you’ve probably come across automated SFTP jobs that do just that. You’ve also likely had to encrypt or decrypt a CSV and had to interpret a schema file with parsing instructions that—somehow—are always a bit off the first time.

Now, sure, we all want to build real-time systems that use LLMs and other flashy new tools and solutions. Sometimes, that’s not what is called for.

After all, companies of all sizes—even tech giants like Facebook and Airbnb—still use SFTP to share critical information for analytical purposes(as well as operational). So, let’s dig into what SFTP is and how you will likely work with it.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

Software Engineer Vs. Data Engineer - Is There A Difference?,0wjngjhmtJA,"Software engineers vs data engineers

What is the difference between a data engineer and a software engineer?

This answer can vary depending on which company and or team you are working on.

In some cases data engineers are more like software engineers that focus on data.

In other cases data engineers are more like BI developers.

This wide range makes it difficult for data engineers as well as companies to really articulate what they want and their skill sets.

Hopefully this video helps discuss some of those differences.

How Much Do Data Engineers Engineers Make? Software Vs Data Engineering Salaries,Sj5iZTkUKmM,"Salaries can play a big role in what job you pick.

Data engineers salaries are often compared to software engineers.

So in this video I have compared data engineering salaries to software engineers using data from the United States Department of Labor (DOL).

I put together a quick dashboard to cover the high points, such as average salaries, max salaries and more.

For example, did you know that one of the highest salaries referenced for a SDE II was 1.4 Million!

You can find the data and quick dashboard here:

How To Prepare For A Data Engineering Interview,XS-To0t9czw,"Interviewing for any technical position generally requires preparing, studying, and long-all day interviews. As a data engineer, what we need to study is not always clear. Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL, some roles require understanding statistics while still others require heavy amounts of system design.

I wanted to create a video to cover some key points for data engineer interviews. 

This video will cover points such as data warehouse design, coding and behavioral questions. I wanted to give the viewer a good high level view of what you should prepare for.

If you enjoy this video on data engineering interviews and want more details, then please comment with your requests.

Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,vwvdtXMcNzI,"Data engineering is now growing faster than data science. I got to thinking, what does this mean for the data domain as a whole. Is this a good thing? Why is it happening now? 

For the most part, data engineering is upstream from data science. The work that they do building data warehouses and data pipelines allows data analysts, data scientists, and ml engineers to build models and create insights from data. Why is this domain, that should precede data science, growing in popularity AFTER data science did? 

For better or for worse, the world doesn’t always work linearly. Data science became sexy because many of the top technology companies were making gobs of money with it. Non-Tech companies saw the value that data science and machine learning was providing and they soon followed suit. 

Unfortunately for many of these companies following the trend, they didn’t have the data infrastructure to properly leverage data scientists. 

I believe the massive uptick in data engineering’s popularity comes from many less technical companies realizing that they made a massive mistake. They needed to hire people to fix their data before hiring all these data scientists.

Data Science, machine learning, AI and Sports Analytics are my passions.  When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost. There were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to help others learn about data science, machine learning, and AI. 

On this channel I produce fun and informative Data Science content. My goal is to make this field more acessible to everyone through commentary, tutorial, and other educational videos. 

I've been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 7 years. I've held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations.  Hopefully my experience will be valuable to you!

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Christopher Garzon. I run the top Data Engineering Academy in the country, where we help students transition into data engineering from other data professions to increase their compensation.

How I got here…

At 18 years old, I started at Boston College.
At 20, I was sneaking into graduate-level classes to take machine learning and data science courses.
At 21, I invested in a data science course from a mentor and wired him $3,000 without ever meeting him.
At 22, I landed my first job as a data analyst at Amazon, making $60,000 per year.
At 24, I became a data engineer at Amazon, increasing my salary to $100,000 and started angel investing in a couple of data companies.
At 25, I moved to a startup as a data engineer and doubled my income to $200,000 per year.
At 26, I was making about $350,000 at Lyft.
At 27, Lyft stocks went up, and my total compensation reached around $450,000. That same year, I launched the Data Engineering Academy.

For the last two and a half years, I’ve been running the Data Engineering Academy full-time, helping thousands of people transition into data engineering and significantly increase their earning potential.

To all the data professionals grinding—your journey is still being written. The bigger the obstacles, the greater the story.

Remember, don’t settle for your next job. Go for a better one.

Now back to the intro:

Simply put, data engineering is all about managing big datasets and extracting information from them efficiently and accurately.
What’s a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is someone who’s responsible for maintaining and building the architecture of data in a DS project.

Some of the main roles and responsibilities of a data engineer include having to ensure an uninterrupted flow of data between server and application, integrating new data management software, improving data foundational processes, and building data pipelines.

The truth is there are lots of various technologies and concepts that data engineers need to take on — working with cloud computing, ETLs, data warehouses, and so much more.

The requirement of data engineers is constantly expanding, and thus we constantly need to continue learning what is changing in the technology world.

In this video, we’ll talk about the top courses you can take to understand how data engineering works.

Data Engineering is Not Data Science - Here's Why | Data Science Myths | Big Data | Data Scientist,GBZGun1-zwk,"Being the hot new professions in IT, both data science and data engineering could cause some confusion amongst tech enthusiasts. Right from the difference between them to what they should opt for. 
While both have the word ‘data’ in them, there is a significant difference between the two. 

What is the role of a data engineer?

A data engineer's responsibility is to construct or combine many components of complex systems while taking into consideration the information needed, the aims of the business, and the demands of the end-user.

What is the role of a data scientist?

Data scientists use their experience in a range of data niches to assist businesses in interpreting and managing data as well as solving complicated challenges.


But, that isn’t the only difference. Watch this quick guide to find out what differentiates them.

Designing a Data Pipeline | What is Data Pipeline | Big Data | Data Engineering | SCALER,Hv1XiSsouU8,"Watch Shashank Mishra (Data Engineer III, Expedia) explain how to create a data pipeline in this exclusive tutorial video. Check out our FREE masterclasses by leading industry experts now: https://www.scaler.com/events?utm_source=osocial&utm_medium=googleyoutube&utm_campaign=brand_scaler_events_osocial_googleyoutube_designing-a-data-pipeline_all&utm_content=description

When designing data pipelines, there are several elements to consider, and early decisions have significant consequences for future performance.
However, before we can grasp the design process, we must first understand what a data pipeline is.

A data pipeline is a series of elements that automatically gather, organise, transfer, convert, and process data from one place to another, ensuring that the data is in a usable condition for enterprises to allow a data-driven culture.
Put in simpler words, 
A data pipeline is a series of activities that ingest raw data from many sources and transport it to a destination for storage and analysis.

The most important thing is to have a flexible, scalable data pipeline that can adapt to new use cases for data while scaling as your data volume grows.

A data engineer is someone who acts as a gatekeeper and facilitator of data transit and storage. They create data reservoirs and are critical in managing such reservoirs. 

Data Engineering, as a profession is fast gaining pace in the data science ecosystem, and due to the strong need for Data Engineers, even FAANG companies are willing to spend a fortune for qualified individuals.

The following topics are covered in this designing a Data Pipeline video: 

00:00 - Introduction
00:57 - Understanding of data domains
02:57 - Choosing data sources
04:43 - Determine the data ingestion strategy
08:37 - Design the data processing plan
11:11 - Set up storage for the pipeline output
13:19 - Plan the data workflow
14:42 - Monitoring and governance tools
16:22 - Designing a demo data pipeline

Sharing this basic roadmap to data engineering. There are many things that I didn’t mention as data engineering is a diverse field. You can specialize in streaming, batch pipelines, data warehouses, data lakes or what not depending on your progress.

This overlaps a lot with backend programming and devops sometimes, so you get the best of both worlds. Feel free to mention other resources you found helpful.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

Being A Data Engineer: Expectations vs Reality,6RiA_Qur2yo,"What is a data engineer?

The goals of a data engineer are much more big-picture and development focused. Data engineers build automated systems and model data structures to allow data to be efficiently processed.

This means the goal of a data engineer is to create and develop tables and data pipelines to support analytical dashboards and other data customers (like data scientists, analysts, and other engineers). 

It's similar to most engineers. There is a lot of design, assumptions, limitations, and development that occurs to be able to create some sort of final robust system.

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

Data Engineer Vs Data Analyst Vs Data Scientist Vs ML Engineer | Data Science Job Roles,93rKZs0MkgU,"A Data Scientist employs advanced data techniques such as clustering, neural networks, decision trees, and the like for deriving business insights. In this role, you will be the senior-most in a team and should have deep expertise in machine learning, statistics, and data handling. You will be responsible for developing actionable business insights after they get inputs from Data Analysts and Data Engineers. You should have the skill-set of both data analyst and data engineer. However, in the case of a data scientist, the skill sets need to be more in-depth and exhaustive.

A Data Analyst occupies an entry-level role in a data analytics team. In this role, you need to be adept at translating numeric data into a form that can be understood by everyone in an organization. Moreover, you need to have required proficiency in several areas, including programming languages such as python, tools such as excel, fundamentals of data handling, reporting, and modeling.  With enough experience under your belt, you can gradually progress from a data analyst to assume the role of a data engineer and a data scientist. 

Data Engineers are the intermediary between data analysts and data scientists. As a data engineer, you will be responsible for the pairing and preparation of data for operational or analytical purposes. A lot of experience in the construction, development, and maintenance of the data architecture will be demanded from you for this role. Usually, in this role, you will get to work on Big Data, compile reports on it, and send it to data scientists for analysis.

I transform the careers of Big data aspirants through my carefully curated masters program to help them evolve into Big data experts. I have put in my wholehearted effort to present to you the best online big data course through the experience gained by having worked on multiple challenging Big data projects as an EX-CISCO and VMware employee.

The journey began in 2018 with my passion for teaching. Started by training a few working professionals, and eventually quit my high-paying job to pursue my passion and to bring about a change in the professional lives of many.

I have incorporated effective learning approaches to master Big Data that have been assimilated over the years as an alumni of top educational organizations like NIT Trichy, BITS Pilani, and IIIT Bangalore.

Become a Data Engineer at FAANG | Data Engineering Career Roadmap | Crack MAANG | SCALER,4vzD8o-aaw0,"In this video, Shashank Mishra (Data Engineer - III, Expedia, Ex-Amazon) walks you through the entire process of becoming a Data Engineer at FAANG companies. Check out our FREE masterclasses by leading industry experts now: https://bit.ly/3J9t7vW

Who is a data engineer?
A data engineer is someone who acts as a gatekeeper and facilitator of data transit and storage. They create data reservoirs and are critical in managing such reservoirs. 

What is Data Engineering?
Data Engineering, as a profession is fast gaining pace in the data science ecosystem, and due to the strong need for Data Engineers, even FAANG companies are willing to spend a fortune for qualified individuals.

Coding Interviews at FAANG. Are They Tough to Crack? 
Short answer. Yes. Every year, FAANG tops the list of the most sought-after companies for programmers around the globe. The salary packages, the working environment, and additional perks are a few reasons why coders want to ace the interview of these companies. Not to forget, the reputation that the FAANG companies entail as well. 

So naturally, when a tech lover decides to pursue a career in data engineering, FAANG companies become an obvious choice. Why?

Global recognition, incredibly high pay packages, a superb learning environment, flexible working hours, and much more are what draw job seekers to FAANG firms.
As a result, getting a job as a Data Engineer in one of these companies is not easy.
FAANG companies receive over a million applications each year, with an approval rate of lesser than 3%.

So, what should one do differently? Here’s a video that will give you a roadmap to becoming a Data Engineer in FAANG.

The episode covers the following topics - 
 
0:00 - Introduction
0:30 - Understanding programming languages
2:24 - Data manipulation libraries
3:25 - Operating systems and scripting
5:56 - Data structures and algorithms
8:22 - Proficiency in DBMS
12:50 - Expertise in data warehousing
13:57 - Big data frameworks

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Christopher Garzon. I run the top Data Engineering Academy in the country, where we help students transition into data engineering from other data professions to increase their compensation.

How I got here…

At 18 years old, I started at Boston College.
At 20, I was sneaking into graduate-level classes to take machine learning and data science courses.
At 21, I invested in a data science course from a mentor and wired him $3,000 without ever meeting him.
At 22, I landed my first job as a data analyst at Amazon, making $60,000 per year.
At 24, I became a data engineer at Amazon, increasing my salary to $100,000 and started angel investing in a couple of data companies.
At 25, I moved to a startup as a data engineer and doubled my income to $200,000 per year.
At 26, I was making about $350,000 at Lyft.
At 27, Lyft stocks went up, and my total compensation reached around $450,000. That same year, I launched the Data Engineering Academy.

For the last two and a half years, I’ve been running the Data Engineering Academy full-time, helping thousands of people transition into data engineering and significantly increase their earning potential.

To all the data professionals grinding—your journey is still being written. The bigger the obstacles, the greater the story.

Remember, don’t settle for your next job. Go for a better one.

What is a Data Engineer?,pERD1Ln_Qh8,"In this webinar, we will explore what is a data engineer. This includes discussing what are the goals, skills, and tools that they use on a daily basis. We wanted to take a moment to provide insights into the other options data professionals have besides data scientists.

Data science has attracted a lot of buzz for almost the last decade. The ability to gain insights from data has driven much of the high-tech companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Google's success. However, it is not the only piece of the data puzzle. Quietly, in the background, behind all the models, metrics, and dashboards, another type of data professional has worked to ensure data scientists have the data they need.

These are the data engineers. Data engineers work in the background managing data pipelines and data storage systems to ensure that the rest of the company can get their dashboards, metrics, and models. They use a variety of tools like SQL databases, Hadoop, and Python and are proficient in data modeling and automation.

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Christopher Garzon. I run the top Data Engineering Academy in the country, where we help students transition into data engineering from other data professions to increase their compensation.

How I got here…

At 18 years old, I started at Boston College.
At 20, I was sneaking into graduate-level classes to take machine learning and data science courses.
At 21, I invested in a data science course from a mentor and wired him $3,000 without ever meeting him.
At 22, I landed my first job as a data analyst at Amazon, making $60,000 per year.
At 24, I became a data engineer at Amazon, increasing my salary to $100,000 and started angel investing in a couple of data companies.
At 25, I moved to a startup as a data engineer and doubled my income to $200,000 per year.
At 26, I was making about $350,000 at Lyft.
At 27, Lyft stocks went up, and my total compensation reached around $450,000. That same year, I launched the Data Engineering Academy.

For the last two and a half years, I’ve been running the Data Engineering Academy full-time, helping thousands of people transition into data engineering and significantly increase their earning potential.

To all the data professionals grinding—your journey is still being written. The bigger the obstacles, the greater the story.

Remember, don’t settle for your next job. Go for a better one.
Chris

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

In this free AWS Data Engineering course we take a deep dive into the services provided by AWS to help us with out with our everyday data engineering needs. The course is created for both AWS beginners and seasoned pro’s alike. I have loosely based this course on the AWS Data Engineering Immersion Day. In fact the Kinesis lab is straight out of the Immersion days booklet.  The rest of the labs take the ideas from the booklet, but translates them so we can build our own use cases at home without being in an instructor led environment. During the course we cover AWS Kinesis, AWS DMS and AWS Glue from both a theory and practical perspective. All slides and code are available on GitHub - link above. I will also make all this information free via my website - again link above.

My journey into the world of data was not the most conventional. I started my career working as performance analyst in professional sport at the top level's of both rugby and football. I then transitioned into a carrer in data and computing. This journey culminated in the study of a Masters degree in Software development. Alongside many a professional certification in AWS and MS SQL Server.

AWS, GCP and MS SQL Server have became my areas of expertise over the years. I have had the privilege of traveling the world to help companies develop innovative solutions to their business problems, so they can derive maximum market value.

Slowly Changing Dimensions For Data Engineers,1FZ7et0pN4c,"Slowly changing dimensions is an important concept in the data warehousing world. If you are developing a traditional data warehouse, then it is a key component to tracking changes over time. 

If you want to track dimension data like who was the manager of a specific team, or what role a person had during what period of time, then slowly changing dimensions comes in handy.

In this video, we will discuss the various types of slowly changing dimensions that exist. In particular, we will be focusing on types 1, 2 and 6.

The next 5 years of Data Engineering in 3 minutes,ApeluDzA2Tg,"Where is data engineering going in the next 5 years?  

We're seeing a bunch of trends here. 

Data Velocity - streaming pipelines will become more common over the next 5 years. Learning things like Scala and Apache Flink (https://flink.apache.org/) will make it so data engineers can be ahead of the game here. 

Data Quality - machine learning is only as good as the data you feed into it. Data engineers who are skilled at creating these checks will be in high demand. Look into Amazon Deequ (https://github.com/awslabs/deequ) and Great Expectations (https://greatexpectations.io/)

Cloud tools - the cloud platforms like Snowflake and BigQuery will continue to make some aspects of data engineering simpler. Learning how to harness the power of these platforms will definitely help grow your career over the next 5 years. 

Data Privacy - laws like GDPR and CCPA are making data privacy and governance trickier. Data engineers who are aware of these laws and how to implement compliant will continue to be in high demand.",2021-12-25T23:40:41Z,38220,1572,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApeluDzA2Tg,Data with Zach,UCAq9f7jFEA7Mtl3qOZy2h1A,"Learn data engineering from the best!

My name is Ishaq (is-haq), Or Zack to some.

I came into tech being self-taught and then through a bootcamp many years ago. At that time there were hardly any resources helping people do the same so I made a pledge to myself to help as many people as I could do the same!

 I found my feet and started giving back to the aspiring developer community, hugely. Helping more self-taught developers and bootcamp grads land their first roles in technology. Through CV reviews, advice, mentoring, technical interview tips and way more.

I wrote a book '11 Steps To Tech, What the Bootcamp Does Not Teach You', and founded  https://juniordeveloper.careers as well as actively helping people on LinkedIn. Receiving hundreds of messages I decided it was time to take my work and my content global by helping self-taught developers all over the world stand out and land their first or second junior developer roles!

How I got Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Certified,bedzsHNSKnA,"I've been upskilling myself on engineering data services on Google Cloud. I didn't meet the prerequisites for the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer certification so I used online courses to get me there.

Do you need to do this certification to be a good data scientist/engineer or machine learning engineer? No.

A certificate is only one way of showing others your skillset. In my role as a machine learning engineer, we partner with businesses who like to put their projects in the hands of people who are professionals (as do we all).

If you have any questions about the certification or anything else to do with machine learning engineering, please feel free to reach out.

In the meantime, here are the links I mentioned in the video.

Why NOT to become a Data Engineer,UjYc8uH6lHw,"I have created multiple videos about data engineering, including a data engineering course for beginners. Why would I advise anyone against pursuing a career in data engineering? I like being as transparent as possible - while this job will be great for many people, it might be disappointing for the others. In this video I'm outlining three reasons why not to become a data engineer. 

If you'd still like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:

1. Learn Python
I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there:
http://imp.i384100.net/x9gVO3

2. Learn SQL
SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark
http://imp.i384100.net/QOMZ09

3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux
I wouldn't take a full course on it, but at least read a good article.
if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good:
https://www.coursera.org/projects/command-line-linux

4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS
There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive

Machine Learning vs Data Engineering - What's the difference?,cbsEWplQH0k,"My FREE guide on how to become a data engineer:
https://karolinasowinska.notion.site/karolinasowinska/Data-Appreciation-Society-8f1940ccc8df4c0baed4eb585dd861b3

This video answers a question that I was getting a lot: ""What's the difference between Machine Learning and Data Engineering?

To make a good comparison between Machine Learning vs Data Engineering, we first need to clarify what we mean by these two areas.

Machine Learning can be actually split into two separate ""camps"": 
-scientists (data scientists, machine learning researchers, machine learning scientists)
-engineers (machne learning engineers).

And data engineers are always engineers :) 

So in this video I compare scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers :) I hope this will help you to decide on a career path!

Datacamp Vs Dataquest? Which Data Engineering Course Is Best - Learning Data Engineering Online,J6r2y8-CMJ4,"Learning data engineering online is hard enough.

So which track is best, Datacamp vs Dataquest?

Don't take my word for it. Please check out both Datacamp and Dataquest's free sections. 

Both do provide some of their initial courses and sections for free. So try them out with the courses below.

Datacamp Data Engineering Track

Dataquest.io
https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-fundamentals-de/


Now, I come out more positively for Datacamp, which I also have an affiliate link for. So I will share both below and allow you to pick which one you like best.

I preferred datacamp only because it had a more realistic view of what a data engineer does. I imagine at some point dataquest will have to also create similar courses if it wants to compete. If this occurs, I will happily make a follow-up video rexamining the two.


Both have data engineering course

About me:
I  have spent my career focused on all forms of data. I have focused on developing algorithms to detect fraud, reduce patient readmission and redesign insurance provider policy to help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. I have also helped develop analytics for marketing and IT operations in order to optimize limited resources such as employees and budget. I privately consult on data science and engineering problems both solo as well as with a company called Acheron Analytics. I have experience both working hands-on with technical problems as well as helping leadership teams develop strategies to maximize their data.

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Christopher Garzon. I run the top Data Engineering Academy in the country, where we help students transition into data engineering from other data professions to increase their compensation.

How I got here…

At 18 years old, I started at Boston College.
At 20, I was sneaking into graduate-level classes to take machine learning and data science courses.
At 21, I invested in a data science course from a mentor and wired him $3,000 without ever meeting him.
At 22, I landed my first job as a data analyst at Amazon, making $60,000 per year.
At 24, I became a data engineer at Amazon, increasing my salary to $100,000 and started angel investing in a couple of data companies.
At 25, I moved to a startup as a data engineer and doubled my income to $200,000 per year.
At 26, I was making about $350,000 at Lyft.
At 27, Lyft stocks went up, and my total compensation reached around $450,000. That same year, I launched the Data Engineering Academy.

For the last two and a half years, I’ve been running the Data Engineering Academy full-time, helping thousands of people transition into data engineering and significantly increase their earning potential.

To all the data professionals grinding—your journey is still being written. The bigger the obstacles, the greater the story.

Remember, don’t settle for your next job. Go for a better one.

Introduction: Data Transformations or Processing | Python Pandas Tutorial for Data Engineering,fT_SBNQJLqA,"Welcome back! In this lecture, we introduce data transformations and processing using Pandas. Transforming raw data into a structured format is a crucial step in any data analysis pipeline. This module focuses on reshaping, aggregating, and enriching datasets to extract valuable insights.

What You’ll Learn in This Lecture
1. Why Data Transformation is Important
Raw data isn’t always ready for analysis—it often requires cleaning, restructuring, and enrichment.
Learn how transformations help in:
✅ Creating new metrics like commission amounts.
✅ Summarizing key trends with aggregations.
✅ Preparing data for visualizations or machine learning models.
2. Real-World Examples of Data Transformation
Using our Toyota Sales Dataset, we’ll demonstrate:

Grouping sales data by representative and calculating total sales per rep.
Creating new columns, like Commission Amount, by multiplying Sale Amount with Commission Percentage.
Merging sales and sales reps data to analyze performance across different regions.
3. Key Transformation Techniques in Pandas
This module covers five fundamental data transformation techniques:
✅ Group By and Aggregations – Summarizing data with totals, averages, and counts.
✅ Adding and Updating Columns – Creating new derived metrics.
✅ Merging and Joining DataFrames – Combining datasets for a holistic view.
✅ Applying Functions – Using custom transformations for rows and columns.
✅ Chaining Transformations – Building efficient data pipelines.

Why This Lesson Matters
Data transformation is the bridge between raw data and insights. Without proper data structuring, it’s difficult to derive meaningful business intelligence. This lesson will help you:
🚀 Understand the importance of modifying and enriching datasets.
📊 Learn techniques to reshape and summarize large datasets.
⚡ Apply best practices for handling missing or inconsistent data.

Key Highlights of the Lecture
✅ Step-by-step guide to transforming Toyota Sales Data for analysis.
✅ Grouping and aggregating data to derive sales insights.
✅ Creating new columns and handling missing values effectively.

4:02 - Run Practice Interviews
7:17 - Don't Cram On The Last Day - Relax


Data science  and data engineering interviews, like other technical interviews, require plenty of preparation. There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions on statistics, programming and machine learning.

Before we get started, there’s one tip I’d like to share.

If we just look at data science interview you will notice that there are several types of interviews that companies conduct.

Some data science interviews are very product and metric driven. These interviews focus more on asking product questions like what kind of metrics would you use to show what you should improve in a product. These are often paired with SQL and some Python questions.

The other type of data science interview tends to be a mix of programming and machine learning.

We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies data science interviews.

Airbnb — Product heavy, metrics diagnostics, metrics creation, A/B testing, tons of behavioral questions and take home material.

Netflix — Product-sense questions, A/B testing, experimental design, metric design

Microsoft — Programming heavy, binary tree traversal, SQL, machine learning

Expedia — Product, programming, SQL, product sense, machine learning questions about SVM, regression and decision tree

This is the third part of the Free Data Engineering Course for Beginners that I've decided to create for you!  Over the course of the four videos, we are going to cover the entire ETL process (extract, transform, load), and at the end we are also going to talk about job scheduling.  

In this course you will build your first data feed (or data pipeline) using Spotify API. This feed will run daily, and it will download the data about the songs that you listened to during a day, and save that data in a SQLite database on your local machine. 

In this video we are going to cover the Load stage of the ETL process, which means that we will be learning how to load the data to SQLite, our chosen database. Most importantly, we will explain basic data engineering concepts relating to databases such as relational vs non-relational databases, storing the data on-premise vs in the cloud, and ORM (Object Relational Mappers) such as SQLAlchemy.

If you'd like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview:

1. Learn Python
I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there:
http://imp.i384100.net/x9gVO3

2. Learn SQL
SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark
http://imp.i384100.net/QOMZ09

3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux
I wouldn't take a full course on it, but at least read a good article.
if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good:
https://www.coursera.org/projects/command-line-linux

4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS
There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive

One of the most critical aspects of the data science approach is our perception of getting the information processed. In developing insights from our accumulated data, we dig out the possibilities. And those possibilities are known as statistical analysis in Data science.
Statistics acts as a tool to gather, extract, analyze, and review data, which is an input to Data science techniques; hence, learning statistics is a baby step toward becoming a data scientist. Great Learning‘s Statistics for Data Science course is for beginners and professionals who want to upgrade their skills in data science domains and learn everything about statistical analysis.

What are the Top 5 Roles in Data Science | Career Opportunities in Data Science Explained | #shorts,Oml821I7Dtc,"Can Data scientist work as a Data Analyst?
What’s the difference between Applied and Research Scientist?
Is ML engineer and Data Scientist the same?

There are so many job roles in the Data Science and Machine Learning industry which can overwhelm you in understanding the differences between them.

In this video, Srikanth Varma, co-founder of Applied Roots, breaks down the 5 most common job roles in the industry, and explains the key differences between each role, so you can be clear about what you're looking for in your next career move.

What is Data Science? 
Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured Data, and apply insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialised programming, and advanced analytics, to uncover and explain the insights buried in data.  

What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data .It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

Busting Data Science Myths: 
It’s easier now than ever before for ideas to spread around the world, including through fact-based communities like the one inhabited by data scientists. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every data science “fact” we hear is actually truthful.

In fact, some commonly known “facts” are little more than hearsay, misinterpretations, or, at worst, outright myths.

Python Programming Language: 
Python is the most widely used data science programming language in the world today. It is an open-source, easy-to-use language that has been around since the year 1991. This general-purpose and dynamic language is inherently object-oriented. It also supports multiple paradigms, from functional to structured and procedural programming. Therefore, it is one of the most popular languages for data science as well. With less than 1000 iterations, it is faster and a better option for data manipulations. 

What is A/B testing?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomised experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics. Essentially, A/B testing eliminates all the guesswork out of website optimisation and enables experience optimisers to make data-backed decisions.

I create videos that showcase what is possible with data science and programming, hopefully sparking that very curiosity.

I try to take a diverse approach to the content I create:
- Short videos that teach one specific concept.
- Tutorials that show what is possible with various python packages or machine learning models.
- Live coding streams where the topics are driven by the chat and community.

Many videos provide tips on becoming a data scientist—learning the necessary skills and the expected salaries in the field. But there isn’t nearly as much content that describes what data scientists do on the job. Today, we’ll address this topic.  
Contrary to what many business stakeholders believe, a data scientist isn’t a magician who can use AI to fix any problem.  
A data scientist’s primary purpose isn’t to pull data from the database either . 
A company that thrives—thanks to its data scientists—can educate those  within the organization that a data scientist’s primary goal is to create business value by using data . A data scientist’s role encompasses different activities, many of which we will describe in this video. Still, the first and most crucial point we need to remember is that the end goal of each task of a data scientist is to create business value. 
Therefore—besides solid statistics knowledge and an ability to use such coding languages as Python, R, and SQL—data scientists need business and communication skills to be successful in their work .

Data Science And Data Analytics - Key Differences | Data Science vs Data Analytics | Intellipaat,wQlW_zxDvm4,"#DataScienceAndDataAnalytics #DataScienceVsDataAnalytics #ShortsVideo #ShortsFeed #Intellipaat 

In this video on “Data Science vs Data Analytics,"" we will look into the key differences between Data Science and Data Analytics.  Data Science is the process that includes acquiring data, cleaning data, exploring data, and building models. Data Analytics is the process of using these models to draw conclusions and make predictions.

✅ Which is better, data science or data analytics?
Choosing between a career in data science and data analysis ultimately depends on your interests and strengths. If you are inclined towards more technical, algorithmic challenges and enjoy delving deep into machine learning and predictive modeling, data science might be the right path.

✅Does data science pay more than data analytics?
Both data analytics and data science have lots of room for growth when it comes to salary and responsibilities. The average annual salary for a Data Analyst is $64,000 and the average annual salary for a Data Scientist is $127,000. As you can see, the average salary for a Data Scientist is higher.

✅Does a data analyst require coding?
Data analysts need to be able to work with large datasets, use statistical methods to analyze the data, and apply mathematical models to interpret the results. They may also need programming languages like Python and R to write and run statistical models and algorithms.",2024-04-30T13:45:04Z,13998,462,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlW_zxDvm4,Intellipaat,UCCktnahuRFYIBtNnKT5IYyg,"Intellipaat is a global online professional training provider.

Wie wird man Data Scientist?,oO-blF4-od4,"💠 Mein komplettes Produktivitätssystem: https://fokus.so



Data Science, was ist das überhaupt? Was macht ein Data Scientist? Was muss man lernen, wenn man eine Data Science Karriere anstrebt? Diese Fragen beantworte ich im heutigen Video.

Dem Beruf des Data Scientists wurde schon 2009 von Hal Varian und einige Jahre später dem Harvard Business Review eine glorreiche Zukunft vorhergesagt. Diese Vorhersage ist eingetreten, Daten spielen eine wichtigere Rolle denn je, und Data Scientists sind auf dem Arbeitsmarkt extrem gefragt.

Data Science ist allerdings ein recht allgemeiner Begriff (""Wissenschaft mit Daten""), der sich in viele Unterbereiche aufgliedern lässt, zum Beispiel: Messung & Metriken, Strategie, Vorhersagen (Time Series Analysis), Korrelationen, Experimente (AB-Tests), Data Engineering (Logging, ETL-Pipelines), Modellierung, Optimierung, Visualisierung, Maschinelles Lernen, Künstliche Intelligenz.

Hinzu kommt, dass man sich mit jedem dieser Bereiche auf einer von drei Stufen beschäftigen kann:
1) Grundlagenforschung (Level: Professor)
2) Angewandte Forschung bzw. Core Data Science (Level: PhD)
3) Anwendung bzw. Product Data Science (Level: Bachelor/Master/PhD)

Um als typischer Data Scientist in einer Firma zu arbeiten, sollte man mathematische Vorkenntnisse haben. Bewerber kommen üblicherweise aus Feldern wie: Informatik, Physik, Mathematik, Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Maschinenbau, Psychologie, ...

Vor allem die Statistik spielt in fast allen Bereichen eine immense Rolle. Darüber hinaus ist ein guter Data Scientist mit Python und/oder R bewandert und hat gute Kommunikationsfähigkeiten.

Peter Wang (Gründer Anaconda) beantwortet die Frage ""Was ist Data Science"" so: data science is a literacy, not a job. Ihm zufolge entwickelt sich Data Science mehr und mehr zu einer allgemein notwendigen Fähigkeit, die keinem einzelnen Berufszweig zuzuordnen ist.

Wenn du anfangen möchtest, dich mit Data Science zu beschäftigen, sind Bücher, Videos oder Vorlesungen zu Statistik und Python eine gute Wahl. Für eine umfangende Einführung empfehle ich Onlinekurse, z.B. den genannten von Coursera, siehe Link weiter unten.

Data science for the environment | Dan Hammer | TEDxBerkeley,ph439t-kTIE,"Since the industrial revolution, as human technology has advanced, the environment has suffered. Dan Hammer is looking to turn this paradigm on its head, as he takes a high-tech approach to preserving the environment by using data science and satellite imagery to monitor and protect forests all around the globe. 
 Dan Hammer received 2017 Pritzker Award for his work to make environmental information more accessible to journalists. He earned his PhD in Environmental Economics from UC Berkeley, where he was a Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. Dan works at an environmental and tech nonprofit that he founded alongside two other Berkeley alumni, including the former CEO of The Nature Conservancy and The Moore Foundation. He previously served as a Senior Policy Advisor on data infrastructure in the Obama White House, as well as a Presidential Innovation Fellow at NASA. Dan was the Chief Data Scientist at the World Resources Institute, where he co-founded Global Forest Watch -- an online platform to monitor deforestation from satellite imagery. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I've been a FAANG data scientist for over a year now. While that's not a lot of time, I've had the amazing opportunity to work with super star data scientists, be mentored by them, and even start mentoring more junior data scientists! I've learned a lot about what it actually means to be a data scientist. In this video, I talk about why you should not be a data scientist.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Entropy (for data science) Clearly Explained!!!,YtebGVx-Fxw,"Entropy is a fundamental concept in Data Science because it shows up all over the place - from Decision Trees, to similarity metrics, to state of the art dimension reduction algorithms. It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.

The below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Python Pandas Documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

I applied to 158 data science internships. Here’s what I’d do if I had to do it all over again.,qSbv-c8o_6c,"Hey, it’s Edrea! Here’s my advice on the data science internship recruitment process. Hope it helps :)

Also, just want to clarify that I am a college undergrad so my experience/advice might not necessarily reflect that of someone applying to masters/phD-exclusive data science internships. Fyi, many of the internships I applied to were taking undergrads AND masters/phD. Btw the ds interview structure looks pretty different from company to company, so keep in mind that these are just lessons based on my personal recruiting process and might not be 100% accurate for every company.

Was ist Data Science?,4rPzdf93fqg,"In diesem Video zeigen wir: Was Data Science ist. Dabei geben wir eine kurze Definition von Data Science, stellen die notwendigen Fähigkeiten von Datenwissenschaftlern vor und zeigen exemplarisch Anwendungsfälle aus der Praxis.


Zunächst gehen wir kurz auf die Grundlagen von Data Science ein. Danach erklären wir, welche Fähigkeiten ein Data Scientist mitbringen sollte, damit er Unternehme erfolgreich unterstützen kann, Daten zu analysieren. Folgende Fähigkeiten sollte ein Data Scientist haben:


1. Mathematische und stochastische Modelle und Methoden bilden die Grundlage für die Analyse und Interpretation von Daten. Von großer Bedeutung sind insbesondere eine hohe Datenqualität und die sorgfältige Auswahl der Merkmale von Daten-Stichproben. Zum Einsatz kommen insbesondere auch Verfahren des maschinellen Lernens.
2. Im Zeitalter großer Datenmengen („Big Data“) ist Datenwissenschaft ohne fundierte Kenntnisse über Datenverarbeitung und ihre Instrumente kaum vorstellbar. Die Computer-Wissenschaft (Informatik) unterstützt die Big-Data-Analyse durch Algorithmen, die für eine effiziente Bearbeitung der jeweiligen Datentypen geeignet sind. Analyse-Tools selektieren aus strukturierten oder unstrukturierten Datenmengen die benötigten wertvollen Informationen. 
3. Spezifische Branchen-Kenntnisse sind unerlässlich, um Daten und Geschäftsprozesse eines bestimmten Unternehmens einordnen und analysieren sowie sinnvolle Handlungsempfehlungen entwickeln zu können. Betriebswirtschaftliches Wissen ist von grundlegender Bedeutung, wenn Datenanalysen zwecks Geschäftsoptimierung durchgeführt werden sollen.



Zum Schluss zeigen wir Anwendungsfälle und Beispiele von Data Science aus der Praxis. Damit wollen wir das Potential von maschinellem Lernen und Data Science für Unternehmen zeigen. 


Nachdem Sie dieses Video gesehen haben, wissen Sie was Data Science ist, welche Fähigkeiten ein Data Scientist haben muss, um erfolgreich zu ein und wie Sie Data Science in der Praxis für sich nutzen können.

"Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)",r-uOLxNrNk8,"Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial for beginners, with exercises included!
NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

Data Science is Not for Freshers 🚫 (Tamil) | data science career opportunities,N5_5p_38SCQ,"🔍 From My Experience: I don't recommend starting a career in data science as a fresher. It requires a lot of time to understand concepts like mathematics, algorithms, statistics, and more in the initial stages.

📚 Alternative Path: While it's possible to do data science without deep mathematical knowledge, you'll need to learn many libraries. As a fresher, it's better to start with data analytics or data engineering roles in data-related jobs.

🦫 About me
I am an Applied Scientist (basically, a blend of Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer) at Twitch/Amazon. Outside of my full-time job I'm a technical mentor at a machine learning bootcamp, and a 1:1 career coach for people looking to break into the field, with a focus on those from non-traditional backgrounds. 

I’m also a Certified Personal Trainer, always busy with too many interests, and really, deeply happy with my life. I hope to be able to help others achieve these things, too.

🦫 About me
I am an Applied Scientist (basically, a blend of Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer) at Twitch/Amazon. I graduated with a Master's in Public Policy in 2020, and am currently pursuing a second Master’s in Computer Science. 

Outside of my full-time job I'm a technical mentor at a machine learning bootcamp, and a 1:1 career coach for people looking to break into the field, with a focus on those from non-traditional backgrounds. 

I’m also a Certified Personal Trainer, always busy with too many interests, and really, deeply happy with my life. I hope to be able to help others achieve these things, too.

Studium Data Science: Besteht Marie ihre schwerste Statistik-Klausur?  | alpha Uni,QBz81-DXnfY,"Marie ist im 2. Semester im Master-Studiengang “Data Science & Statistics” an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in München, wo sie die Pflichtvorlesung “Statistical Inference” in Statistik besucht. Für Marie ist diese Vorlesung inhaltlich das schwerste Modul im “Data Science & Statistics” Master-Studium. Auch Programmieren steht hier auf der Tagesordnung! Zusätzlich zur Veranstaltung wird auch eine Übung angeboten, in der es wöchentlich „Homework-Sheets“ als Aufgabe zu lösen gibt. Diese werden im Anschluss korrigiert und die Studis sehen unmittelbar, wie sie mit dem neuen Statistik-Stoff zurechtkommen. Hat Marie tatsächlich alles verstanden, um gut auf die Statistik-Klausur vorbereitet zu sein? 

Bereits während des Bachelor-Studiums an der LMU München stand bei Marie und ihren Kommilitoninnen und Kommiltonen ein Programmier-Praktikum an. Dabei lernten die Studierenden das Programmieren mit diversen Programmiersprachen und wie sich das für eine große Datananalyse nutzen lässt. Das hat sie inzwischen hinter sich, aber im Master wird’s nicht unbedingt leichter. Wie kommt Marie mit ihrem Data Science Studium und ihrem aktuell schwersten Modul zwischen Programmieren, Statistik und Punktewolken-Plot klar? Und ist sie auf die Prüfung wirklich vorbereitet? In der aktuelle Folge Alpha Uni erfahrt ihr’s!

Data Science, machine learning, AI and Sports Analytics are my passions.  When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost. There were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to help others learn about data science, machine learning, and AI. 

On this channel I produce fun and informative Data Science content. My goal is to make this field more acessible to everyone through commentary, tutorial, and other educational videos. 

I've been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 7 years. I've held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations.  Hopefully my experience will be valuable to you!

Junior Data Scientist | Собеседование | karpov.courses,Us_TKT8ZL2E,"Курс Start ML: https://bit.ly/3SdB7Am

Лучший способ подготовиться к собеседованию — пройти его в тестовом режиме.

Мы записали mock-интервью, которое состоит из 4-х секций: Python, ML, работа с данными и А/В Тесты. В независимости от уровня соискателя есть пул обязательных вопросов на знание основ Data Science и пул дополнительных вопросов в зависимости от уровня подготовки и опыта кандидата.

Именно эти секции позволяют оценить широту знаний собеседуемого. Вопросы дают понять, умеет ли он составлять запросы к БД, писать код, строить модели и проверять их работу с помощью А/В-тестов. Все эти знания достаточно быстро проверяются на mock-собеседовании.

Нашего гостя будет собеседовать преподаватель программы Hard ML Станислав Гафаров. Включайте, чтобы узнать, какие вопросы могут встретиться в интервью на позицию junior DS!

"2025 The The Intersection of Ethics, Data Science, Informatics, and Epidemiology",PMfEt2_tYnI,"On ethics, science, and society—how do we make health data work for everyone? In today’s world, health data are everywhere—they help scientists track disease outbreaks, notice health trends, and improve medical care. All these data come with important questions: Who has access to them? How are they used? Is their use fair and safe for everyone? This symposium explores how experts from different fields—ethics, data science, informatics, and epidemiology—work together to make sure health data are used responsibly. We will discuss real-world challenges like protecting people’s privacy, getting consent before using personal data, and ensuring that health decisions are fair for all communities, especially those who have been—and continue to be—underrepresented, underprivileged, or underserved (the ""triple Us""). By bringing together different viewpoints, we can understand how to make public health efforts effective, ethical, transparent, and just.

This video will teach you all the fundamentals of data analysis in just 10 minutes. First, we'll go over how to transform or clean up a raw set of data on Excel. This will include using features like the trim formula, data types, removing duplicates, and more. Then, we'll look at descriptive statistics using the data analysis feature on Excel. This will give us important numbers like the average, min, max, quartiles etc. We'll also create a box and whisker chart for analysing outliers. Third, we'll analyze the data using pivot tables. Finally, we'll create a small report using conditional formatting, xlookups, sumifs and more.

In this tutorial using a real-world dataset on the Olympics, we go over the 4 core steps of data analysis in excel. First, we clean up the data. For this, we create a backup of the raw dataset, remove duplicates, and more. Then, we transform the data. This includes replacing certain values, filling in the blanks, and using the TRIM and PROPER functions to clean up. Third, we do the analysis with Pivot Tables and functions, where our manager is asking us a series of questions. Finally, we visualize the data with charts and pivot table slicers.

I've always been passionate about turning information into insights. From crushing spreadsheets in college to now working with complex datasets, data analysis has been my jam.  But the explosion of data volume can be overwhelming, even for the most seasoned analysts.

That's where AI comes in! A recent McKinsey study found that companies using AI for data analysis see a 10-20% increase in their operational efficiency.   This is HUGE for making smarter decisions, faster.

That's why I'm excited to share my latest discovery: ASKYOURDATABASE!   This AI-powered platform takes the grunt work out of data analysis, letting me focus on what matters most - uncovering hidden patterns and generating actionable insights.

Here's what I love about ASKYOURDATABASE:

Effortless Exploration: Ask questions in plain English and get instant results, even with complex datasets.
AI-Powered Insights: Uncover hidden trends and relationships you might miss on your own.
Actionable Reporting: Generate clear, concise reports to share with your team and stakeholders.

"Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)",r-uOLxNrNk8,"Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial for beginners, with exercises included!
NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

What it is: Microsoft Excel is the perfect program for viewing and analyzing data.

What you'll learn: Beyond simple averages and totals, Microsoft Excel offers many features to help you draw insights from your data. Sometimes those observations come from a particular formatting or visualization of the data; other times a specific summary function will generate a surprisingly significant result. In this full-length introductory course, learn all about data analytics in Excel with tools like table formatting, conditional functions, charting, Pivot Tables, and much more.

3 Data Analysis Projects to Boost Your Resume 
👋 Hey everyone! I'm thrilled to share some of my proudest achievements in the world of data analysis. Over the past year, I've dived deep into some fascinating projects that showcase my skills and passion for turning data into actionable insights. Here's a sneak peek into three standout projects that have enriched my resume:

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for E-commerce Sales
Using Python, Pandas, and various visualization libraries, I analyzed a real e-commerce dataset to uncover trends, segment customers, and evaluate product performance. This project honed my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. It's a foundational project that every data analyst should master. Check out my GitHub for all the details!

2️⃣ Movie Recommendation System
Leveraging collaborative filtering techniques, I built a recommendation system with Python and machine learning libraries using the MovieLens dataset. This project not only enhanced my data manipulation abilities but also gave me hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and model evaluation. It's a perfect example of practical machine learning applications. Explore the code on my GitHub!

3️⃣ Stock Market Analysis and Prediction
I analyzed historical stock market data and developed a basic prediction model using ARIMA. This project involved data acquisition from financial APIs, time series analysis, and forecasting techniques. It's a great demonstration of my ability to handle financial data and predict market trends. Dive into the project on my GitHub!

💡 Did you know? According to a study by the Harvard Business Review, data analysis is one of the most in-demand skills in today's job market, with companies increasingly relying on data-driven decision-making. These projects not only showcase my technical abilities but also my readiness to tackle real-world challenges in the data domain.

In this video you'll learn the essentials of data analysis broken down into data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. In the data cleaning section, we'll use Power Query to clean up a raw set of data. This will include changing formats, merging columns, and trimming spaces. Then, in the analysis phase, we'll answer some questions about our data using pivot tables. Finally, in the visualization phase, we'll use conditional formatting, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data.

🔥Data Analyst Vs Data Scientist | Which is better for you ? #Shorts #Simplilearn,OJyCtg6cdto,"In this video on Data Analyst Vs Data Scientist, we dive deep into the world of data to explore the key differences between Data Analysts and Data Scientists. If you're considering a career in data or just curious about the roles, this video is perfect for you!

Here are some examples:

1️⃣ Calculating Totals and Averages:
Use the SUM and AVERAGE functions to calculate totals and averages of numeric columns.

👉Example: SUM[SalesAmount] to get the total sales amount.

2️⃣ Conditional Calculations:
Use the IF function to create conditional calculations.

👉Example: IF[SalesAmount (greaterthan) 5000, ""High"", ""Low""] to categorize sales as high or low.

3️⃣ Filtering Data:
Use the CALCULATE function to modify the context of a calculation and apply filters.

👉Example: CALCULATE[SUM(SalesAmount), (Region) = ""East""] to get the total sales amount for the East region.

4️⃣ Time Intelligence:
Use functions like DATEADD, PARALLELPERIOD, and TOTALYTD to perform time-based calculations.

👉Example: TOTALYTD[SUM[SalesAmount], [Date]] to calculate the year-to-date total sales amount.

5️⃣Creating Relationships:
Use the RELATED function to bring in data from related tables.

👉Example: RELATED[Customer[CustomerName]] to get the customer name from the related Customer table.

المتوسط (Mean)
الوسيط (Median)
الانحراف المعياري (Standard Deviation)
الاحتمالات (Probability)
اختبار الفرضيات (Hypothesis Testing)
الخطوة الثانية: تعلم برنامج إكسل (Excel)
إكسل من الأدوات الأساسية في تحليل البيانات. يجب أن تتعلم:

الدوال مثل VLOOKUP، SUMIF
الجداول المحورية (Pivot Tables)
الرسوم البيانية (Charts) لعرض البيانات بشكل مرئي
الخطوة الثالثة: تعلم لغة البرمجة بايثون (Python)
بايثون واحدة من أشهر اللغات المستخدمة في تحليل البيانات. يجب أن تبدأ بتعلم:

Pandas: لتحليل ومعالجة البيانات
Numpy: للعمل مع المصفوفات والعمليات الرياضية
Matplotlib و Seaborn: لإنشاء الرسوم البيانية
الخطوة الرابعة: SQL
البيانات غالباً ما تكون مخزنة في قواعد البيانات، وهنا تأتي أهمية SQL. يجب أن تتعلم:

أساسيات استعلامات SQL لجلب البيانات وتنقيحها من قواعد البيانات.
الخطوة الخامسة: جمع وتجهيز البيانات
تحليل البيانات يبدأ من تجميع البيانات وتنظيفها. يجب أن تتعلم تقنيات:

تنظيف البيانات: إزالة القيم المفقودة والأخطاء
تحويل البيانات: تحويل البيانات الخام إلى تنسيق جاهز للتحليل
الخطوة السادسة: عرض البيانات (Data Visualization)
العرض البصري للبيانات يساعدك في فهم الأنماط والاتجاهات. يمكنك استخدام:

Matplotlib و Seaborn لإنشاء المخططات المختلفة
Tableau و Power BI لإنشاء لوحات البيانات التفاعلية
الخطوة السابعة: تعلم الآلة (Machine Learning)
إذا كنت ترغب في الانتقال إلى المستوى المتقدم، يجب أن تبدأ بتعلم مبادئ تعلم الآلة باستخدام مكتبات مثل:

Scikit-learn: لتطبيق النماذج المختلفة مثل الانحدار (Regression) والتصنيف (Classification)
الخطوة الثامنة: البيانات الضخمة (Big Data)
في المشاريع الكبيرة قد تحتاج إلى تعلم كيفية التعامل مع البيانات الضخمة باستخدام:

Hadoop
Spark
نصائح عامة
لا تتوقف عن التعلم! المجال دائم التطور، حاول متابعة كل جديد.
التطبيق العملي مهم جداً: حاول بناء مشاريع صغيرة أثناء التعلم لتطبيق ما تتعلمه.

🔥 Salary Of Data Analyst  | How Much Does A Data Analyst Make? #Shorts #Simplilearn,uuEw84qQEWQ,"In this short on data analyst salary, we'll delve into the factors that influence earnings in this dynamic field. Data analysts are indispensable players in today's data-driven economy, tasked with unraveling insights from vast datasets to drive informed decision-making.

At the heart of a data analyst's skill set lies proficiency in coding languages such as Python, R, and SQL, alongside a solid grasp of mathematics. These technical skills enable them to manipulate and analyze data efficiently, extracting valuable insights. Moreover, adept project management abilities ensure that analyses are structured, milestones are met, and results are delivered in a timely manner.

Remaining updated with industry trends is crucial for data analysts to stay relevant in an ever-evolving landscape. Continuous learning and adaptation to emerging technologies and methodologies empower analysts to leverage cutting-edge tools and techniques in their work. Additionally, effective storytelling skills are essential for translating complex data findings into actionable insights that drive business decisions.

While advanced degrees like a Ph.D. can bolster one's credentials, formal education requirements for data analysts are flexible. Degrees in fields such as computer science, statistics, mathematics, or economics provide a solid foundation for a career in data analysis. However, practical experience and a demonstrated ability to apply analytical skills are often equally valued by employers.

In terms of compensation, salaries for data analysts vary based on factors such as experience, industry, and geographic location. Entry-level positions typically offer modest to moderate salaries, ranging from 6 to 12 lakhs per annum in India. However, with increasing experience and expertise, data analysts can expect their earnings to grow significantly over time.",2024-05-07T12:19:15Z,477650,20342,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuEw84qQEWQ,Simplilearn,UCsvqVGtbbyHaMoevxPAq9Fg,"Simplilearn is the world’s leading online training provider and has helped over 8 million professionals, and corporations acquire the skills they need to succeed in the digital economy.

Here are the Top AI Tools for Research Data Analysis,_7JyuA1nAKk,"In this video, I dive deep into the world of AI tools and how they can transform data analysis. AI has become an essential part of data science, helping us extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. I decided to test three popular AI tools to find out which one excels in data analysis: Julius AI, Vizly, and the latest version of ChatGPT.

I started with a public healthcare dataset, which is perfect for evaluating the capabilities of these AI tools. First, I input the data into Julius AI and was impressed by the range of visualizations it produced, such as the distribution of hospital codes and stay lengths. One feature I particularly liked about Julius AI is its self-correcting mechanism, which ensures the analysis remains accurate.

Next, I tested Vizly. This tool also provided insightful visualizations and added a layer of interactivity with its graphs. I could zoom in and out and interact with the data points, which made the analysis more engaging. However, it had some limitations when dealing with more complex, unstructured data.

Finally, I turned to ChatGPT for data analysis. This tool stood out with its ability to create interactive graphs and its thorough analysis plans. One feature that set it apart was its ability to hold metadata in memory and provide a step-by-step breakdown of its analysis process. ChatGPT was also able to confirm its findings by recalculating efficiency, which added an extra layer of reliability to its results.

AI helps in research by making data analysis more efficient and accurate. Whether you're dealing with structured or unstructured data, these AI tools can provide valuable insights that can drive better decision-making.

Exploratory Data Analysis With Excel - Part 1 - Basic Numerics,1zEFJHbG0aE,"My full tutorial on exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Microsoft Excel. In this series I will introduce you to some of the most useful data analysis techniques in business analytics using trusty old Excel.

Throughout the series I will show you how to use the best that Excel has to offer for EDA:

1 - The mighty Data Analysis ToolPak
2 - Data visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and bar charts.
3 - Pivot tables
4 - Pivot charts

These are the same techniques that I've used in my hands-on analytics work (e.g., as part of my EDA for building machine learning models).

Open Interest Data Analysis || OI Data || OI Change || Explained | Angel One,YnDaqzp5pYQ,"📊 Master the Art of Open Interest (OI) Analysis – The Ultimate Guide for Traders!

If you’ve ever wondered what Open Interest really means and how it can impact your trades, this video is a must-watch! Whether you're a beginner trying to understand the basics or an experienced trader looking to refine your market reading skills, we’ve got you covered.

In this comprehensive video, we break down how to analyze Open Interest and OI Change data in real-time to identify bullish or bearish trends, support & resistance levels, and market sentiment.

💡 Here’s what you’ll learn in this video:
🔍 What is Open Interest (OI)?
📈 How to find & read OI data in the options chain
🧠 How to interpret OI bars (green for buying pressure, red for selling pressure)
📉 Using OI Change to track real-time market sentiment shifts
📊 How to identify key strike prices acting as support or resistance
✅ Understanding PCR (Put-Call Ratio) & its significance
🔄 How OI changes during the day and why you must monitor it constantly
📌 Practical example with Nifty 50 strike prices (23,200 to 23,500 range)

We’ll also explain how multi-strike OI tools help in tracking specific call and put levels and confirm market direction with high accuracy. By learning how to interpret OI correctly, you’ll avoid false signals and make more informed trading decisions.

Open Interest shows how many contracts are currently active in the market. It helps you understand where the big players are placing their bets, and whether the market is showing signs of strength or weakness.

Whether you're trading Nifty, Bank Nifty, or individual stock options, understanding OI trends can give you a significant edge in the market.

These Excel Functions Make Data Analysis Easy,IV1Q1wkod4M,"How to use Boolean logic, IF statements, AND, OR, XOR, and to automate decisions and analyze data.

99% of Excel users don’t fully understand how logical tests work, and it shows. This knowledge can be the difference between writing monstrous nested IF formulas or writing a simple formula that achieves the same result without using IF at all. Logic is at the core of Excel, powering advanced filters, formulas, conditional formatting, and more. 

In this video, we’ll explore key logic functions - AND, OR, NOT, and XOR (exclusive OR)  - and how they work. Plus, I’ll take you behind the scenes to show how Excel uses logic in arrays for calculations beyond these built-in functions.

هذه هى الكورسات المطلوبة فى مجال ال Data Analysis  من الالف للياء,OZpB0ltDaPM,"السلام عليكم .. متابعيني الأعزاء
يشرفنى إشتراك حضراتكم فى القناة وفى حالة وجود أي إستفسارات يشرفنى الرد عليها عبر ترك رساله فى تعليقات هذا الفيديو والرد عليها فوراً، ولتقديم إقترحاتكم للفيدوهات القادمة ولمتابعة كل جديد أدعوكم للتفضل بزيارة الصفحة الرسمية على موقع الفيسبوك Facebook  بأسم Mostafa Attia

ال Data Analysis لها كورسات كتير أونلاين بمسميات مختلفة وكل كورس فيهم بيخدم نقطة معينة أو مهارة معينة عند ال data analyst
ف دايماً يُفضل لو مش هتاخد منحة مثلاً زي ال ITI أو ALX ، ف الاتجاه الافضل هيكون الكورسات المنفردة أونلاين
مبدأياّ كدا ك Data Analyst مطلوب منك شوية مهارات لازم يكونوا معاكي في البداية ك entry level
1) Soft skills
زي Communication - Questioning - Teamwork - Critical Thinking
دي ال soft skills اللي عادة بتكون ضروري موجودة في ال Data Analyst والحاجات دي لها كورساتها المتخصصة لوحدها لكن في مسار جوجل بتقدمه مكون من 8 كورسات بيركزوا خلالهم إن ال soft skills تتطور فيك بنسبة 70 أو 80% وال 20% الباقيين بيركزوا على جانب ال Technical skills اللي هبدأ أتكلم عنها
بس قبل ما ابدأ ، دا لينك المسار على Coursera
https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics

2) Technical skills 
ودي نقدر نقول شوية Tools وشوية Programming languages
الشركات بتهتم إنهم يكونوا في ال Data Analyst
طب زي ايه؟
- Statistics
لازم على الأقل يكون معايا ال basics ودا ضروري جداً لا غنى عنه، طب اذاكر ايه فيه ممكن يكفيني ك entry level؟ ممكن نتكلم عن ال Descriptive statistics ، وفيما بعد نبدأ نذاكر Inferential statistics و ممكن Probability لو احتاجنا مثلاً نروح لل Machine Learning Engineering
لكن خلينا بشكل مبدأي نروح لل Descriptive statistics 
المصطلحات دي ممكن تبدأي تدوري عليها وتفهمي عنها عشان صعب أشرحها كلها في كومنت
المهم في كورسات كتير جداً بتتكلم عن ال descriptive statistics على يوتيوب ، دا مش معضلة بإذن الله
- MS Excel
مهم تكون بتعرف تستخدمه كويس جداً ويمكن دي أهم tool لازم تكون بتعرف تستخدمها
ودي كورساتها موجوده بكثرة سواء يوتيوب أو غيره
- SQL
دي لغة برمجة بتستخدم لاستخراج الداتا من ال databases ، طب ايه هي ال databases؟ دي مكان لتخزين الداتا بردو بشكل منظم، طب ليه مش بنخزنها في Excel sheet عشان ال database بتخزن داتا أكتر كتير من ال Excel sheet ولأسباب تانية بردو بس دي أهمها
لذلك في شركات عندها كم كبير من الداتا فبتحتاج حد يعرف يتعامل معاها ويستخرجها ودا بيبقى عن طريق ال SQL
ف المهم إني أعرف ال syntax بتاعة ال SQL وبعد كدا أشوف tool ابدأ استخدمها زي على سبيل المثال SQL Server أو SQL Developer
- PowerBI / Tableau
دول اتنين tools من شركات مختلفة وظيفتهم الأساسية هي ازاي ت visualize ال Raw data ال طلعت من ال analysis اللي انت عملتها عشان تبقى مفهمومة لكل الناس

طيب بالنسبة ل SQL و PowerBI و Tableau ألاقي كورساتهم فين
عندك منصات كتير زي datacamp - datascience365 - Udacity 
وكمان اليوتيوب عليها كورسات متفرقة لكن بصراحة كورسات قيمة جداً ، وممكن تكون كورسات مش كاملة بس زي ما بدأت كلامي إن مفيش كورس كامل خصوصاً في ال DA لكن في كورسات متفرقة هتخدم مهارات معينة

حاجة تانية بردو ممكن نلجأ لمنحة ال FWD من وزارة الاتصالات ، بس مش عارف هي لسه فاتحة ولا لأ بصراحة

- Python
دي لغة برمجة ممكن نقول إنها ممكن تقوم بوظيفة ال Excel و ال SQL و PowerBI و Tableau عادي جداً
وفي ناس بتستخدمها ك بديل لحاجة واحدة منهم ، المهم في شركات بنحتاج يكون معاكي Python ودي لغة برمجة هتحتاجي تذاكري ال basics بتاعتها
وال Python كورساته مالية اليوتيوب
بس دايماً أنا بفضل ك بداية كورس مع بشمهندس محمود أحمد (Mahmoud Ahmed) أو في ناس كتير كانت بترشح Codezilla مع بشمهندس إسلام محفوظ
وفي ناس بترشح مذاكرته من الكتب
المهم أنا كان ترشيحي الأفضل هو مذاكرة ال basics مع اللي تستريحله منهم وتدخل بعدها علطول على FWD ، طب ليه ؟ عشان كورسات ال FWD ميزتها إنها بتطبق كل المفاهيم بتاعة ال Data Analysis أو ال Statistics ال هم شرحوها عن طريق بايثون ، ف دي ميزة بتخليك تدرب أكتر على بايثون بالإضافة لفهم أعمق للحاجات اللي اتشرحت
وبعد ما نذاكر ال Python هنشوف tool بتتسخدم بايثون زي Jupyter notebook مثلاً

ف لو جينا ن list الskills اللي أنا قولت عليها
Soft skills .. Descriptive statistics .. Excel .. SQL .. PowerBI / Tableau .. Python (Preferred)

آخر حاجة حابب أتكلم عنها وهي إن للأسف ال titles بتاعة مجالات الداتا كلها داخلة في بعض حالياً ، بمعنى إن للأسف كله بيعمل شغل بعضه ، ف دايماً الأفضل إننا نبص على ال description بتاع الوظيفة هو دا اللي هيحدد المهارات المطلوبة متوفرة فيا ولا لأ

بالتوفيق

شكرا جزيلا


شكراً لكم.

ชื่อ นัทครับ ความฝันที่ใหญ่มากๆเลยคืออยาก ""เปลี่ยนแปลงระบบการศึกษา"" ของบ้านเรา

ชอบเรียน ชอบออกกำลังกาย ชอบแชร์ ชอบเล่า

เอาเรื่องนั้นบ้าง เรื่องนี้บ้าง แต่ที่ตัวเองถนัดสุดนี่ก็่าจะเป็นเรื่อง Data นี่แหละสำหรับตอนนี้

""นี่จะเป็นก้าวเล็กๆ ของการเปลี่ยนแปลงที่ยิ่งใหญ่ในสังคม ที่ทุกคนอยากจะเห็น อยากให้เป็นก็ได้""

Excel Pivot Tables - Master Data Analysis in just 45 minutes,zuSNd1ZMfBI,"👉 Check out my complete Excel course - https://chandoo.org/wp/excel-school-program/

While Excel formulas are powerful, you also need to plan and think hard before writing them to solve business problems. This is why I love Pivot tables. They are really easy to make and provide the biggest bang for buck. We can use Pivots to analyze data and answer business questions effectively and elegantly in short amount of time.

In this lesson, learn how to:
    ◉ Create a pivot table from your data
    ◉ Using the fields panel to construct your ""dream"" pivot
    ◉ Work with report filters, top 10 filters and sort options

"StatQuest: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Step-by-Step",FgakZw6K1QQ,"Principal Component Analysis, is one of the most useful data analysis and machine learning methods out there. It can be used to identify patterns in highly complex datasets and it can tell you what variables in your data are the most important. Lastly, it can tell you how accurate your new understanding of the data actually is.

In this video, I go one step at a time through PCA, and the method used to solve it, Singular Value Decomposition. I take it nice and slowly so that the simplicity of the method is revealed and clearly explained.

If you are interested in doing PCA in R see: https://youtu.be/0Jp4gsfOLMs

If you are interested in learning more about how to determine the number of principal components, see: https://youtu.be/oRvgq966yZg

Teach me STATISTICS in half an hour! Seriously.,kyjlxsLW1Is,"THE CHALLENGE: ""teach me statistics in half an hour with no mathematical formula""

The RESULT: an intuitive overview of distributions, sampling and hypothesis testing that (almost) scrapes in under 30 minutes :) 

Whether you're studying statistics for the first time or are just curious as to what the study of statistics is all about, this video is a great introduction to several core concepts.

Oh, and all the examples I use come from the 2018-19 NBA season.

Steph's 3 point percentage is what is called a 'ratio', which is numeric. It can be argued to be discrete (as for a given number of attempts, there are only so many possible percentages that can be achieved), or continuous (if we allow the number of attempts to change). Heated arguments either way here are semantic, in my opinion :)

Lộ trình học Data Analyst cho người mới | Cách nhanh nhất trở thành Data Analyst,ZqvTVRWM5i4,"Lộ trình học trở thành Data Analyst cho người mới là gì? Cách nhanh nhất để trở thành 1 Data Analyst như thế nào? Chúng ta cần học những công cụ nào (SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI hay Tableau), chuẩn bị tư duy phân tích, kỹ năng ra sao? Câu trả lời sẽ được bật mí trong chiếc video hôm nay. 

Và chắc chắn, mình sẽ loại bỏ hết tất cả những gì không cần thiết để tiết kiệm tài chính và học đúng, học đủ để sớm có được công việc Data Analyst. Vì mình biết, chỉ có đi làm thực tế, chúng ta mới phát triển nhanh hết mức có thể. 

Câu chuyện của mình bắt đầu từ lúc đi làm vào năm tư đại học tại ngân hàng Techcombank. Công việc này cho mình gần 2 năm kinh nghiệm xử lý hàng chục ngàn dòng dữ liệu với Excel, 6 tháng lăn lộn cùng Power BI, và bỏ túi hàng giờ học trên Udemy cũng như trung tâm ngoài trước khi apply cho vị trí Data Analyst chính thức và có gần 4 năm làm Data Analyst tại VNG.

Tất cả những chia sẽ này được đút kết từ chính trải nghiệm của mình. Cho nên, mình hi vọng bạn xem và góp nhặt những điều thấy có ý nghĩa cho bản thân. 

Gợi ý lộ trình trở thành Data Analyst bạn cần có: 
1. Chuẩn bị Mindset 
2. Làm quen với Excel 
3. Nắm vững kiến thức thống kê
4. Rèn luyện kỹ năng SQL
5. Thành thạo visualization tool 
6. Tốt hơn nếu biết Python 
7. Xây dựng Profile, Portfolio
8. Không từ bỏ

Fundamentals of Statistics for Data Analysis | Python Pandas Tutorial for Data Engineering,VznyBIWlmnc,"In this video, we will discuss the foundational concepts of statistics essential for data analysis, demonstrating practical applications using the Pandas library in Python. Perfect for beginners, this tutorial breaks down complex ideas into easy-to-understand steps.

Learn how to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights! This video covers the essential statistics every aspiring data analyst needs to know. We start with the basics: defining statistics for data analysis and why it's crucial. We'll explore different types of data and then dive into measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode. You'll also learn to measure the spread of data using range, variance, and standard deviation. Understanding data shape with skewness and kurtosis is also covered. Finally, we'll explore correlation, a key method for measuring relationships between variables.

*Topics Covered:*
* Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis
* Types of Data in Statistics
* Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode
* Measures of Spread: Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation
* Understanding Data Shape: Skewness and Kurtosis
* Measuring Relationships: Correlation
* Hands-on Pandas Examples with Real-World Data

Using Python and Pandas, we'll apply these concepts to a real-world example: analyzing car sales data for a dealership. Discover how to calculate average sales price, understand price variation, and assess sales rep performance - all using the power of statistics. Whether you're aiming to build machine learning models or simply improve your data analysis skills, mastering these basic statistical concepts is the first step!

I Hate Data Analysis 😅 | EP 12,tPQkNa5gGCQ,"Love gathering data but hate analysing it? You’re not alone. 😅

🔹 Talking to people? Love it.
🔹 Digging through endless comments? No thanks.
🔹 AI helps, but nothing beats a great data person.

Lesson? You don’t have to do it all—just know where to bring in the right people.

Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ertugrulesol/online-retail-data (Source: Kaggle)

Prompt 1: I want to build an excel dashboard. I have provided you with  the sample data. Carefully analyze this data and suggest what information we should display on the dashboard and how?

Prompt 2: ( Insert sample json data format)

This is the structure of my sales data in JSON format. Understand the structure and suggest five key data visualization metrics that would be the best fit to create an interactive sales dashboard. Also explain why we should use each one? 

Include metrics like - revenue by product names, revenue by gender, order count by payment method, sales over time, revenue by category. 

Prompt 3 - Now, I want you to create an interactive sales performance dashboard with the above key visualizations using HTML and JavaScript. Use the latest version of Plotly.js CDN and include an upload feature so that we can upload the JSON file. It should generate the dashboard based on the uploaded data. Note: I need to upload the sales data from my local computer, and it should create the dashboard based on that data.

#18 Exploratory data analysis | Python for Data Science,q4pyaVZjqk0,"Welcome to 'Python for Data Science' course !

This video focuses on uncovering patterns and relationships within your data. The lecture introduces frequency tables for understanding the distribution of categorical variables, like fuel type in the car dataset (). You'll learn how to handle missing values when creating these tables. 
It then covers two-way tables for exploring relationships between two categorical variables, for example, fuel type and gearbox type. You'll see how to calculate joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities from these tables to make inferences about variable relationships. 
Finally, the video introduces correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables, using the car dataset to demonstrate its calculation and interpretation. It emphasizes that understanding these exploratory data analysis techniques is crucial for generating hypotheses and deriving meaningful insights from your data.

Hyperspectral Data Analysis with Spectronon: Spectral Angle Mapper & Logistic Regression Classifiers,WfHvHRJbjA0,"In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to perform preliminary hyperspectral data analysis using our Spectronon™ hyperspectral software. You'll learn how to apply two powerful hyperspectral classification algorithms — Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Logistic Regression — to classify two different types of red candy.

What You'll Learn:
• How to use Spectral Angle Mapper to classify hyperspectral data using reference spectra
• How to use Logistic Regression to perform pixel-level classification with probabilistic output
• How to interpret colormaps and visualize your classification results

In this example, we classify two types of red candies (Candy A and Candy B) to determine whether any of Candy A appears in a mixed cluster. We use both SAM and Logistic Regression algorithms to show how you can begin to evaluate hyperspectral data you have collected.

Spectronon is our advanced hyperspectral imaging software. It supports a range of machine learning and analysis algorithms, works with user-written plugins, and has an intuitive user interface designed for both researchers and industry professionals. Best of all, it is free for anyone to use and it works with all common hyperspectral datacubes.

📊 How to Build Excel Interactive Dashboards,MTlQvyNQ3PM,"In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how to create dynamic and interactive Excel dashboards. With a dashboard, you can showcase the most important information and key performance indicators (KPIs) that your organization cares about. All you need is Microsoft Excel -- there's no need for any VBA or add-ons. When you receive new data, you can easily update your dashboard to reflect the latest. You can adjust the look and feel using various themes and you can even customize the dashboard to match your organization's color scheme. Once you finish, you can share out your dashboard easily for others to consume. If you'd like to follow along, you'll find the sample sheet that I used below.
